Diffusion and functional MRI (d/fMRI) generally employ echo-planar imaging (EPI) for fast
whole-brain acquisition.
Despite the rapid collection of volumes, typical repetition times are long enough for head motion
to occur, which has been proven detrimental to both diffusion [1]_ and functional [2]_ MRI.
In the case of dMRI, additional volume-wise, low-order spatial distortions are caused by
eddy currents (EC), which appear as a result of quickly switching diffusion gradients.
Unaccounted for EC distortion can result in incorrect local model fitting and poor downstream
tractography results [3]_, [4]_.
*FSL*'s ``eddy`` [5]_ is the most popular tool for EC distortion correction, and
implements a leave-one-volume-out approach to estimate EC distortions.
However, *FSL* has commercial restrictions that hinder application within open-source initiatives
such as *NiPreps* [6]_.
In addition, *FSL*'s development model discourages the implementation of alternative data-modeling
approaches to broaden the scope of application (e.g., modalities beyond dMRI).
*NiFreeze* is an open-source implementation of ``eddy``'s approach to estimate artifacts
that permits alternative models that apply to, for instance, head motion estimation in fMRI 
and positron-emission tomography (PET) data.
